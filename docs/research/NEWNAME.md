# Naming Inspiration: Jules Verne's "The Mysterious Island"

## Aerostat and Granite

This document explores two naming candidates drawn from Jules Verne's 1874 novel *The Mysterious Island* (*L'Île mystérieuse*).

### Aerostat

In the original French text, Verne uses **"aérostat"** as the technical term for the balloon. This was period-appropriate scientific terminology—from Greek *aēr* "air" + *statos* "standing", referring to any lighter-than-air craft that maintains static buoyancy.

The novel opens with five Union prisoners escaping the siege of Richmond, Virginia during the American Civil War. They steal a military observation balloon tethered in the city square and cut the mooring cables during a storm, eventually crashing near a mysterious Pacific island.

**Why it fits**: The interpreter is the balloon—light, flexible, carried by currents of thought. It can go anywhere, adapt to conditions. The word suggests elevation—rising above the constraints of traditional implementations.

### Granite (Granite House)

The castaways' fortress-home, discovered by Engineer Cyrus Smith. It's a natural cave high in a granite cliff, blasted and carved into a secure dwelling with multiple rooms, accessible only by rope ladder (later a hydraulic elevator).

**Why it fits**: The Nim compilation backend is Granite House—solid, fast, permanent. Carved from native stone (Nim → C → machine code). It's where you retreat when you need performance and stability.

### The Duality

The dual nature of this Smalltalk implementation maps beautifully to Verne's world:

- **Aerostat**: Dynamic, exploratory, REPL-driven development
- **Granite**: Compiled, deployed, rock-solid execution

You can live in the balloon (interpreted) or the fortress (compiled)—or move between them as needed.

### Possible Combined Names

- **Aerostat** — Emphasizes the dynamic, elevated nature
- **Granite** — Emphasizes the solid foundation
- **Aerostat/Granite** — Suggests the layered architecture
- **Aerostat-on-Granite** — Dynamic capabilities resting on solid native foundation
