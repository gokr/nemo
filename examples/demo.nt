# Nimtalk Demo - What's Working Now
#
# This demonstrates the currently working features:
# - Integer literal evaluation
# - String literal evaluation
# - Basic object creation (via clone)
#
# Note: Arithmetic operators are not yet implemented,
# so 3 + 4 = 7 as syntax doesn't work yet.

# These work:
42
"Hello, Nimtalk!"

# Object creation works but message sending is limited:
# Object clone  # This fails currently - message sending incomplete

# The goal: Eventually this will work:
# 3 + 4
