# N-Queens Benchmark
# Ported from SOM benchmark suite (https://github.com/smarr/SOM)
# Expected result: true (8-queens puzzle is solvable)
# NOTE: Simplified version for current Nimtalk limitations

# The full 8-queens requires:
# - Arrays for tracking board state (freeRows, freeMaxs, freeMins, queenRows)
# - While loops for iteration
# - Backtracking algorithm

# Current Nimtalk limitations:
# - whileTrue: loops don't iterate properly
# - Arrays don't support integer indexing with at:put:
# - Tables only support string/symbol keys

# Placeholder to demonstrate structure
# TODO: Implement when array indexing and loops work properly

true
