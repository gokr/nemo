  - Added text manipulation methods to TextView/SourceView:
    - `insertText:at:` - Insert text at position offset
    - `selectRangeFrom:to:` - Select text range
    - `insertTextAtSelectedEnd:` - Insert text after selection
    - `getSelectionEnd` - Get selection end position
  - Implemented Smalltalk-style Print It in Workspace
  - Print It now inserts result in editor (after selection) and selects it for easy deletion
