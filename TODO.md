## Build Quick Reference

```bash
nimble local       # Build and copy binaries to root directory (recommended)
nimble build       # Build harding and granite
nimble test        # Run tests
nimble clean       # Clean artifacts
nimble install     # Install harding to ~/.local/bin/
```

### Debug Builds

```bash
# Build with debug symbols
nim c -d:debug --debugger:native -o:harding_debug src/harding/repl/harding.nim

# Debug with GDB
gdb --args ./harding_debug script.harding
```

### Logging Options

```bash
harding --loglevel DEBUG script.harding    # Verbose tracing
harding --loglevel INFO script.harding     # General information
harding --loglevel WARN script.harding     # Warnings only
harding --loglevel ERROR script.harding    # Errors only (default)
```

## Recent Completed Work

### Complete Stackless VM Migration (2025-02-08)
- Removed the old recursive evaluator (`evalOld`, ~1200 lines deleted)
- All execution now goes through the stackless VM work queue
- Re-entrant evaluation via `evalWithVM` for native methods that need to call Harding code
- Control flow primitives (`ifTrue:`, `ifFalse:`, `whileTrue:`, `whileFalse:`, block `value:`) handled by VM work frames
- Fixed captured variable propagation through nested blocks (MutableCell sharing)
- Fixed non-local returns from deeply nested blocks (`homeActivation` walks to enclosing method)
- Fixed `doesNotUnderstand:` fallback in VM dispatch
- Fixed escaped blocks with non-local returns to exited activations
- Renamed entry points: `doitStackless` -> `doit`, `evalStatementsStackless` -> `evalStatements`
- All 14 tests pass

### Automatic Accessor Generation (2025-02-07)
- `deriveWithAccessors:` - Creates class with auto-generated getters and setters for all slots
- `derive:getters:setters:` - Creates class with selective accessor generation
- Getters use O(1) SlotAccessNode for fast direct slot access
- Setters use O(1) SlotAccessNode for fast direct slot assignment
- Added comprehensive tests in test_stdlib.nim
- Updated documentation in MANUAL.md and QUICKREF.md

### Script Files and Temporary Variables (2025-02-07)
- Script files auto-wrapped in `[ ... ]` blocks before parsing
- Temporary variables can be declared at file level: `| var1 var2 |`
- Scripts execute with `self = nil` (Smalltalk workspace convention)
- No need for uppercase globals in simple scripts
- Shebang support for executable scripts: `#!/usr/bin/env harding`
- evalScriptBlock implementation in stackless VM
- Documentation updates for script execution in MANUAL.md and QUICKREF.md

### Debug Logging Improvements (2025-02-07)
- Converted DEBUG echo statements to proper debug() logging calls

- Cleaner normal script execution (no unwanted debug prints)
- Logging updates across VM and codebase

### Documentation and Cleanup (2025-02-06)
- Updated README.md with concise example and proper documentation links
- Fixed all example files to use `new` for instance creation (not `derive`)
- Fixed all example files to use double quotes for strings (not single quotes)
- Updated all documentation to match current syntax
- Renamed .nemo files to .hrd extension throughout codebase
- Fixed QUICKREF.md title (was "N Syntax")
- Fixed VSCODE.md to reference correct grammar file (harding.tmLanguage.json)
- Updated README to use `granite` consistently (was `granite`)
- Updated all shebang lines from `nemo` to `harding`
- Fixed examples/README.md with correct binary and extension names

### Exception Handling (2025-02-03)
- Implemented exception handling via `on:do:` mechanism
- Created Exception class hierarchy (Error, MessageNotUnderstood, SubscriptOutOfBounds, DivisionByZero)
- Errors in Harding code now use Nim exceptions with stack traces

### Process, Scheduler, GlobalTable (2025-02-03)
- Process class as Harding-side object with pid, name, state methods
- Process control: suspend, resume, terminate
- Scheduler class with process introspection
- GlobalTable class and Harding global for namespace access
- All processes share globals via `Harding`

### Multiple Inheritance (2025-02-01)
- Conflict detection for slot names in multiple parent classes
- Conflict detection for method selectors in multiple parent classes
- `addParent:` message for adding parents after class creation
- Override methods in child to resolve conflicts

### Green Threads (2025-01-31)
- Core scheduler with round-robin scheduling
- Process forking with `Processor fork:`
- Each process has isolated activation stack
- Shared globals between all processes
- Process states: ready, running, blocked, suspended, terminated

### Method Definition Enhancements (2025-01-31)
- `asSelfDo:` for self-rebinding blocks
- `extend:` for batching instance methods
- `extendClass:` for class-side (factory) methods

- Multiline keyword messages (newline-aware)
- `#====` section header comments

- Comprehensive syntax highlighting for `.harding` files
- TextMate grammar with language configuration
